# DCOT: Double Core Tensor Factorization for Heterogeneous Data


This directory contains source code for the paper "Regularized and Smooth Double Core Tensor Factorization for Heterogeneous Data" [[arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10454)]. 


# Installation

 1- Requirement
 
The algorithms have been implemented in MATLAB and make extensive use of the Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB. You can find the latest version at https://www.tensortoolbox.org/ .


2- Setup

Run run_me_first_to_add_dcot_libs_.m for path configurations.

Please make sure that **tensor_toolbox-master** and **DCOT-master** can be seen from MATLAB (i.e. make sure to run addpath on their paths).


3- Simplest usage example

Execute demo.m for the simplest demonstration of this package. This is the case of CMU face recovery problem.
